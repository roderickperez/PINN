# Physics Informed Neural Networks

This repository is intended to share some of my recent findings in the understanding, understanding and applycation of PINN's. The framework used to develop the code was PyTorch.
* Approximate Function
* Simple ODE
* 1D PDE
* 2D PDE

Special tahnks to Juan Diego Toscano (@jdtoscano94) for sharing some of the code that I used to created this notebooks.
